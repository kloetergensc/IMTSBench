This is the Git Repository from 
	
IMTSBench: A Benchmark for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting based on ODEs (Kloetergens et. al, 2024),
submitted to The Thirty-eight Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

The code to recreate the benchmark can found in the data_creation folder. 
Alternatively, the benchmark can also be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/records/11492058
The downloaded folder should be copied to data/IMTS_benchmark_datasets/ and renamed to imts_bench

To train models on the benchmark check the experiments folder and follow the README.md contain in
